If you're like me, and you're constantly browsing [Moviefone.com](http://www.moviefone.com/) or [IMDB.com](http://imdb.com) for new movies to watch, you'll probably want to share the movies you're interested in with [your seafaring friends](http://piratereverse.info). This little extension will let you do that with one click. Just go to the page of the movie you want, open the extension and choose either "Open" or "Download"! In the option page of this extension, you can switch between TPB proxies, or supply your own!
